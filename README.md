# Three Lines 4.0 - Predictive Process Monitoring for Internal Audit

Research in predictive process monitoring exists mainly from the perspective of process and risk
owners. Moreover, existing guidelines from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) omit process
mining and/or process predictions for internal audit. Attempting to bridge this gap, we implement
a framework which redefines the role of internal audit using predictive process monitoring within
the Three Lines model. It takes into account that internal audit should not interfere with the
obligations of the first two lines and still reduce risk and prevent undesired outcomes. In order
to do so, this paper proposes fixed time buckets for training and runtime in order to temporally
move the prediction towards the outcome but still leave the audit clients engough time to prevent
undesired outcome. Using machine learning methods and implementing a classical internal audit
use case, payment punctuality, with a publicly available event log, we show that internal audits can
use process predictions to provide assurance, reduce risk and prevent undesired outcomes.
